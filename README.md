---

OryvexCore finds a route that works on your network, opens an encrypted tunnel through it and serves that tunnel as a local SOCKS5 proxy (or, on Android, a whole-device VPN). It is built for networks with deep packet inspection, protocol fingerprinting, UDP throttling and endpoint blocking.

## Highlights

- **Finds its own way out.** Scans for reachable gateways and only trusts one after real traffic passes through it.
- **Four tunnels.** MASQUE over HTTP/3 or HTTP/2, classic WireGuard, WireGuard in MASQUE (`gool`) and MASQUE in MASQUE (`mim`) for a different exit address.
- **Hard to fingerprint.** Chrome-shaped TLS, ClientHello fragmentation, obfuscation profiles from `light` to `gfw`.
- **Extra exits.** Tor through the tunnel, Tor alone, or Psiphon through the tunnel (desktop).
- **Stays up.** Automatic reconnect, and quick reconnect to the last gateway that worked.
- **Runs anywhere.** Windows, Android, Linux, macOS, OpenWrt routers, Termux and Docker.

## The apps

| Platform | Download | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android 5.0+ | `OryvexVPN-android-*.apk` | Whole-device VPN (VpnService + hev-socks5-tunnel) or proxy only |
| Windows 10 / 11, 64-bit | `OryvexVPN-windows-x64.zip` | Desktop app, optional system proxy, Tor and Psiphon bundled |
| Windows 7 / 8 / 10 / 11, 32 and 64-bit | `OryvexVPN-windows-legacy-*.zip` | OryvexVPN Lite, a tiny native Win32 app |

The desktop and Android apps share one design: a black canvas, Inter and JetBrains Mono type (bundled, no network fetch), and one blue for every action. While you connect, the Connect page shows each stage of the chosen protocol live (identity, gateway scan, tunnel, proxy, then Tor, Psiphon or the device VPN when they apply). **Activity** shows the core's log with level tags, folded repeats and one-tap copy.

## Build

Everything is built by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/apps.yml` for the apps, `release.yml` for tagged releases). Run `bash tools/set-repo.sh <user>/<repo>` once before your first push to replace the `OWNER/OryvexCore` placeholders.

**Core** (Rust stable, a C/C++ compiler, CMake):

```bash
cd oryvexcore
cargo build --release                 # add --features tor for Tor support
./target/release/oryvexcore --masque --turbo -4
```

**Desktop app** (Flutter 3.32.8, see `apps/shared/flutter-version.txt`):

```bash
cd apps/desktop-src
bash tool/bootstrap.sh                # or tool/bootstrap.ps1 on Windows
flutter build windows --release
# then copy the core to build/windows/x64/runner/Release/core/oryvexcore.exe (next to OryvexVPN.exe)
```

**Android app** (Flutter, NDK r28, cargo-ndk):

```bash
cd apps/android-src
bash tool/bootstrap.sh
bash tool/build_android_natives.sh all   # core + VPN engine into android/app/src/main/jniLibs
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

Optional release signing: add the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` and `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` secrets. Without them the APKs are signed with the debug key.

**Lite** (Windows, Rust nightly for Windows 7 targets): `cd apps/desktop-lite-src && cargo build --release`.

## Command line

```bash
oryvexcore                                   # answer the questions as they come
oryvexcore --masque --turbo -4               # nothing asked, straight to work
oryvexcore --wg --thorough --noize gfw       # WireGuard on a strict network
oryvexcore --gool                            # WireGuard inside MASQUE
oryvexcore --mim --h2                        # MASQUE inside MASQUE over HTTP/2
oryvexcore --masque --tor                    # plus a Tor exit on --tor-bind
```

Then point apps at `socks5h://127.0.0.1:1819`:

```bash
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1819 https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace
```

Every flag has an environment variable; `oryvexcore help` lists them all. The proxy has no authentication: bind it to `0.0.0.0` only on a network you trust.

## Docker

```bash
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:1819:1819 -v oryvexcore-data:/data ghcr.io/owner/oryvexcore:latest
```

Keep the `-v` volume: it holds your WARP identity, and a new identity on every start gets rate limited. Publish the port to `127.0.0.1` only.

## Termux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/OryvexCore/main/oryvexcore/scripts/oryvexcore.sh -o oryvexcore.sh
chmod +x oryvexcore.sh && ./oryvexcore.sh install
```
